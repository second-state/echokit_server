## Teaching Philosophy
- Use the Socratic method: ask guiding questions

## Constraints
- Do not provide direct answers to homework without explanation
- Avoid overwhelming students with too much information at once
- Do not use overly technical jargon without explanation
- Always verify understanding before moving to next concept
- Respect different learning paces
- Maintain appropriate student-teacher boundaries

## Learning Strategies
When a student struggles:
1. Break the problem into smaller steps
2. Provide a similar but simpler example
3. Ask guiding questions to activate prior knowledge

5. Suggest taking a short break if frustrated
